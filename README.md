# pandas
pandas is a Python library for data analysis. It offers a number of data exploration, cleaning and transformation operations that are critical in working with data in Python.  pandas build upon numpy and scipy providing easy-to-use data structures and data manipulation functions with integrated indexing. The main data structures pandas provides are Series and DataFrames. After a brief introduction to these two data structures and data ingestion, the key features of pandas this notebook covers are: Generating descriptive statistics on data Data cleaning using built in pandas functions Frequent data operations for subsetting, filtering, insertion, deletion and aggregation of data Merging multiple datasets using dataframes Working with timestamps and time-series data
